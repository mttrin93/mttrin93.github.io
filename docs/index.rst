Matteo Rinaldi
==============

I am a theoretical physicist specializing in Computational Condensed Matter Physics, with a strong focus on quantum mechanical and atomistic simulations. My research centers on developing machine learning force field frameworks for molecular and condensed matter systems. I work extensively with widely used programming languages and tools, including Python and TensorFlow, to build scalable and accurate simulation models. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the `Theory Department <https://www.fhi.mpg.de/th-department>`_ of the `Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society <https://www.fhi.mpg.de/>`_ in Berlin.
